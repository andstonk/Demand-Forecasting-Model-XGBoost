# Demand-Forecasting-Model-XGBoost

📊 Demand Forecasting Model
📌 Overview

This project contains a demand forecasting model built using Python and machine learning techniques. It is designed to analyze historical data and generate demand forecasts to support energy market planning and decision-making.

The notebook (DemandForecastingModel-20250713.ipynb) includes:

Data preprocessing and feature engineering

Exploratory data analysis (EDA)

Model training and evaluation (statistical + ML-based approaches)

Forecast visualization and performance metrics

⚙️ Requirements

Make sure you have the following installed:

Python 3.8+

Jupyter Notebook / JupyterLab

Required Python libraries:

pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn xgboost statsmodels

Do you want me to also generate a requirements.txt file automatically from your notebook (so that your GitHub repo is plug-and-play), or should I just keep it in the README?

how does license work?

Good question 👍

On GitHub, a license tells other people what they are (and aren’t) allowed to do with your project. By default, if you upload code to GitHub without a license, it’s “all rights reserved” — meaning nobody can legally copy, modify, or use your code, even if it’s public.

Adding a license makes it clear what others can do. Here’s a breakdown of common open-source licenses:

🔑 Popular Open-Source Licenses

MIT License (most popular & simple)

✅ Anyone can use, copy, modify, and distribute your code

✅ Even for commercial purposes

❌ No warranty (if something breaks, you’re not liable)

📌 Good if you want maximum freedom for others to use your code

Apache 2.0 License

Similar to MIT, but also explicitly grants patent rights

Often used by big companies (Google, Apache projects)

📌 Good if your project might involve patents

GPL v3 (GNU General Public License)

Anyone can use, copy, modify, and distribute

BUT: if they distribute a modified version, they must also release it under GPL (open-source must stay open-source)

📌 Good if you want to enforce sharing back

BSD 3-Clause

Like MIT, but with some extra wording on endorsements

📌 Similar freedom, but more formal

⚖️ How it works

You add a file called LICENSE in your repo root.

GitHub detects it automatically and shows it on the repo page.

Example (MIT License snippet):

MIT License

Copyright (c) 2025 Your Name

Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy
of this software and associated documentation files (the "Software"), to deal
in the Software without restriction...

🧭 Which one should you use?

If you just want others to freely use your work → MIT License

If you want companies to contribute back modifications → GPL v3

If you want free use but also want to cover patents → Apache 2.0

👉 Do you want me to generate a LICENSE file (MIT) for your project, so you can just drop it into your repo?

Got it 🚀 I’ll draft a GitHub-ready README.md for your project DemandForecastingModel-20250713.ipynb. You can copy this directly into a README.md file in your repo:
