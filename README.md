# Demand-Forecasting-Model-XGBoost

📊 Demand Forecasting Model
📌 Overview

This project contains a demand forecasting model built using Python and machine learning techniques. It is designed to analyze historical data and generate demand forecasts to support energy market planning and decision-making.

The notebook (DemandForecastingModel-20250713.ipynb) includes:

Data preprocessing and feature engineering

Exploratory data analysis (EDA)

Model training and evaluation (statistical + ML-based approaches)

Forecast visualization and performance metrics

⚙️ Requirements

Make sure you have the following installed:

Python 3.8+

Jupyter Notebook / JupyterLab

Required Python libraries:

pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn xgboost statsmodels
